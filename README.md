# Sales Analysis
## Project Overview
Welcome to my Tableau dashboard showcase, where I present interactive visualizations revealing insights into sales data. The dashboard features a comprehensive overview of total sales revenue by country in a donut chart, offering a clear snapshot of each country's contribution. Additionally, the stacked bar chart illustrates the geographic distribution of sales by displaying the percentage contribution of each country to the total sales amount. Meanwhile, the bar chart showcases average sales per border, allowing stakeholders to gauge the efficiency of sales operations across different regions. Lastly, the visualization of product sub-sales categories offers a detailed analysis of sales trends within each category, empowering users to identify top-performing segments and areas for growth. With interactive features such as hovering and filtering, stakeholders can delve deeper into the data, gaining actionable insights to optimize sales strategies and drive business success. Explore the dashboard and unlock the power of data-driven decision-making for enhanced performance and profitability.

## Dataset
For this analysis, we utilized dataset from MS SQL. The dataset contains various attributes, such as Id , Total Sales , Sales Category, Sales Subcategory, Order Quantity, region etc. The first phase of the project involved performing EDA by the use of SQL. During EDA, data was examined, checked for missing values, and gained initial insights into the data distribution. EDA provided crucial insights that laid the foundation for further analysis. In the second phase of the project, we focused on analyzing different tables by joining them to get useful and needful insights. We used window funtions like Row no , Dense Row Rank etc to classify sales on different factors. The final phase of the project involved leveraging the power of Tableaut create interactive data visualizations.
